# React Tic Tac Toe

For **SEI 1019** this is a week-long deliverable, **due Monday, Decemeber 14**.

Follow the [React tic tac toe tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html)!

You'll notice there are two options for setup that the tutorial offers. Do **Setup Option 2: Local Development Environment**. Make the project a github repo and commit as you go.

## How to submit:

- Fork & clone this repository
- Add to this `readme.md`below!
- Pull request :D

## Paste the link to your finished repo here:

I made the react app in this repo!

## Write a brief `reflection` on what you learned from this tutorial here:

In this tutorial I got a better understanding of props, and learned about why immuteablity is important. I also learned how to lift the state of a component up (ex. passing state from the parent component to the child and back to the parent), how to make an interactibe component, and how to store a history of states in a component.
